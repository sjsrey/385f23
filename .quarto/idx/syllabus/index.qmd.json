The focus is on both the conceptual and applied aspects\nof spatial statistical methods. We will place particular emphasis on\nthe computational aspects of Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA)\nmethods for three diï¬€erent types of spatial data: point processes,\nlattice, and geostatistical. We will also cover an introduction to\nregression analysis on spatially referenced data. Throughout the\ncourse you will gain valuable hands-on experience with several\nspecialized software packages for spatial data analysis. The\noverriding goal of the course is for you to acquire familiarity with\nthe fundamental methodological and operational issues in the\nstatistical analysis of geographic information and the ability to\nextend these methods in your own research.\n\n\nThe course takes an explicitly computational thinking\napproach to its pedagogy. Students are introduced to computational\nconcepts and tools that are increasingly important to research that\nengages with geospatial data. By adopting these tools, students\nacquire a deeper engagement with, and mastery of, the substantive\nconcepts. Students will learn to code, and code to learn spatial data analysis.\n\nIn the scope of a 15-week semester course we can only introduce a handful\nof the key concepts and methods relevant to the field of spatial data analysis. As\nsuch, the course is not intended as an exhaustive treatment. Instead,\nthe goal is that students will acquire an understanding of the more\ncommon and useful methods and practices, and use the course as an entry\npoint for further engagement with the field.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n\n- [GEOG 101](https://catalog.sdsu.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=5&coid=31440) or [GEOG 102](https://catalog.sdsu.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=5&coid=31442) \n- [STAT 250](https://catalog.sdsu.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=5&coid=33000) or comparable course in statistics.\n\nAll students are required to complete the [prerequisite assessment quiz](https://sdsu.instructure.com/courses/116162/quizzes/224625) before Monday 1/24 11:59pm.\n\n## Computational Learning\n\nWe will using [open\nsource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) geospatial\nsoftware throughout the course together with [Jupyter\nNotebooks](https://jupyter.org), and [Python](https://python.org) as our\nscripting language.\n\nAll software for the course will be made available through\n[JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/) a web-based framework. Students\nwishing to install these materials on their own machines will be given\ninstructions to do so, **but this is not required**.\n\n\n## Readings\n\nAll required readings are available through the links listed\nbelow. Assigned readings should be completed before the date listed in\nthe schedule (see below). Readings are a critical part of the\ndiscussions we will hold in class, and therefore coming into class\nprepared means having completed the readings and thought about the\ncontent. It will be difficult to do well in this course without having\ncompleted the readings.\n\n| Abbrevation | Source                                                                                      |\n|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| GDS         | Rey, S.J., D.

[specification\ngrading](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2016/01/19/new-ways-grade-more-effectively-essay)\nin evaluating student work and in determining your final course grade.\nYour course grade will be based on the quality and quantity of the work\nthat you submit that is evaluated to be of an acceptable level of\nquality. The acceptable level of quality demonstrates competency in the\nconcepts and methods covered in the course.\n\nThere is a two-step process for determination of your final course grade\nat the end of the quarter:\n\n1.  Using your quizzes, exercises, and projects, your **base grade** is\n    determined.\n2.  Using your final exam results, determine if your base grade includes\n    a \\\"plus\\\", \\\"minus\\\", or level drop to form the course grade.\n\nFor Step 1, the base grade is determined using the following\nspecification:\n\n  Level   Hurdles\n  ------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  A-       Pass at least 13 of 15 quizzes, earn \\\"Demonstrates Competency\\\" on 4 of 4 exercises,\n          **and** submit a project that earns \\\"Demonstrates Competency\\\"\n  B       Pass at least 11 of 15 quizzes, earn \\\"Demonstrates Competency\\\" on 3 of 4 exercises\n  C       Pass at least 9 of 15 quizzes, earn \\\"Demonstrates Competency\\\" on 2 of 4 exercises\n  D       Pass at least 7 of 15 quizzes, earn \\\"Demonstrates Competency\\\" on 1 of 4 exercises\n  F       Fail to clear D-level hurdles\n\nFor Step 2, your final course grade is determined as follows:\n\n-   If you earn at least 85% on the final exam, you will obtain a + for\n    your grade. So an A- base grade becomes a final A course grade, a B\n    becomes a B+, and so on (Note: SDSU does not record A+ grades).\n-   If you score between 70-85% on the final exam, your base grade\n    becomes your course grade.\n-   If you score between 50% and 69% on the final exam, you will obtain\n    a - for your grade. So an A becomes and A-, a B becomes a B-, and so\n    on.\n-   If you score less than 50% on the final exam, your course grade will\n    drop one level: An A- base grade becomes a final B- course grade.\n\n## Quizzes\n\nQuizzes are graded on a pass/fail basis. Starting in week two, there\nwill be a quiz due before each Monday session that pertains to the\nbackground reading that is required before our work in class.\n\n## Exercises\n\nFour exercises will be introduced in class and are to be completed outside of\nclass meetings.\n\nEach exercise is graded using a **CRN** rubric that classifies work with\nmarks of **C** (\\\"Demonstrates Competence\\\"), **R** (\\\"Needs\nRevision\\\"), or **N** (\\\"Not assessable\\\"):\n\nOf each exercise the following questions will be asked: Does the work\ndemonstrate that the student understands the concepts? Does the work\ndemonstrate competence and meet the expectations outlined in the\nexercise?\n\nIf the answer is \\\"yes\\\" to both of the questions, a student passes the\nhurdle for that exercise.\n\nIf the initial submission does not clear the hurdle, then a second\nquestion is asked: Is there evidence of partial understanding of the\nconcepts? If the answer to this question is \\\"Yes\\\" the student can\nexchange one token to attempt a revision of their work. If the answer is\n\\\"No\\\", the student does not clear the hurdle for this exercise and will\nnot have the opportunity to revise their work.\n\n\n## Final Exam\n\nA closed book, closed note, timed final exam will be given on **December 18\n(13:00-15:00)**. The exam will be based on a blend of previous quiz questions\nand additional questions that pertain to material covered in class.\n\n## Tokens\n\nEach student is provided with three tokens at the beginning of the\nsemester.\n\nUsing Tokens\n\n1.  One token can be used for a one-day extension for an exercise.\n\n2.  One token can be used to revise an exercise that was submitted\n    on-time but evaluated as \\\"Needing Revision\\\".\n\n3.  Two tokens can be used to request a make-up date for the final exam.\n   (Requests required by November 18 17:00.)\n\n\nRemaining Tokens\n\nEach token that remains unused after **12-18** will be counted as a passed\nquiz. *Tokens cannot be exchanged with other students*.\n\n## Policies\n### Accomodations\nIf you are a student with a disability and are in need of\naccommodations for this class, please contact Student Ability\nSuccess Center at (619) 594-6473 as soon as possible.  Please know\naccommodations are not retroactive, and I cannot provide\naccommodations based upon disability until I have received an\naccommodation letter from Student Ability Success Center.\n\n### Privacy and Intellectual Property\nStudent Privacy and Intellectual Property: The Family Educational\nRights and Privacy Act (FERPA) mandates the protection of student\ninformation, including contact information, grades, and graded\nassignments. I will use Canvas to communicate with you,\nand I will not post grades or leave graded assignments in public\nplaces. Students will be notified at the time of an assignment if\ncopies of student work will be retained beyond the end of the semester\nor used as examples for future students or the wider public. Students\nmaintain intellectual property rights to work products they create as\npart of this course unless they are formally notified otherwise.\n\n\n### Academic Integrity\n\nThe SDSU student academic integrity policy lists violations in detail.\nThese violations fall into eight broad areas that include but are not\nlimited to: cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, facilitating academic\nmisconduct, unauthorized collaboration, interference or sabotage,\nnon-compliance with research regulations and retaliation. For more\ninformation about the SDSU student academic integrity policy, please see\nthe following: <https://sacd.sdsu.edu/student-rights/academic-dishonesty>.\n\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nAs course instructor, I am dedicated to providing a harassment-free\nlearning experience for all students, regardless of gender, sexual\norientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,\nor choice of operating system. All course participants are expected to\nshow respect and courtesy to other students throughout the semester. As\na learning community we do not tolerate harassment of participants in\nany form.\n\n-   All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience\n    including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and\n    imagery are not appropriate in this course.\n\n-   Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other students. Behave\n    professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or\n    exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for this course.\n\n-   Students violating these rules may be asked to leave the course, and\n    their violations will be reported to the SDSU administration.\n\nThis code of conduct is an adaptation of the [SciPy 2018 Code of\nConduct](https://scipy2018.scipy.org/ehome/299527/648147/index9a04.html).\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n<hr>\n\n## Class meetings\n\n| Meeting | Location | Time                   |\n|---------|----------|------------------------|\n| Lecture | [LSN 111](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=801#!ct/62917,40419,15205,54894,71456?m/617937) | Mon & Wed 3:30 - 4:45pm |\n\n## Teaching team \n\n| Name                                                     | Office hours      | Location                                                                                                                      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| [Sergio Rey](https://geography.sdsu.edu/people/bios/rey) | [Thu 3:30 - 4:30pm (by appointment)](https://calendly.com/sjsrey/office-hours) | [PSFA 361G](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=801#!ce/12160?ct/62917,40419,40418,20161,15205,48503,54894,16202,12164?m/147097?s/) |\n| TBA                                              | TBA   | [PSFA 361F](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=801#!ce/12160?ct/62917,40419,40418,20161,15205,48503,54894,16202,12164?m/147097?s/) |\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nWelcome to 385: Spatial Data Analysis!\n\n\nThe purpose of this course is to introduce you to methods of spatial\ndata analysis.

[specification\ngrading](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2016/01/19/new-ways-grade-more-effectively-essay)\nin evaluating student work and in determining your final course grade.\nYour course grade will be based on the quality and quantity of the work\nthat you submit that is evaluated to be of an acceptable level of\nquality. The acceptable level of quality demonstrates competency in the\nconcepts and methods covered in the course.\n\nThere is a two-step process for determination of your final course grade\nat the end of the quarter:\n\n1.  Using your quizzes, exercises, and projects, your **base grade** is\n    determined.\n2.  Using your final exam results, determine if your base grade includes\n    a \\\"plus\\\", \\\"minus\\\", or level drop to form the course grade.\n\nFor Step 1, the base grade is determined using the following\nspecification:\n\n  Level   Hurdles\n  ------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  A-       Pass at least 13 of 15 quizzes, earn \\\"Demonstrates Competency\\\" on 4 of 4 exercises,\n          **and** submit a project that earns \\\"Demonstrates Competency\\\"\n  B       Pass at least 11 of 15 quizzes, earn \\\"Demonstrates Competency\\\" on 3 of 4 exercises\n  C       Pass at least 9 of 15 quizzes, earn \\\"Demonstrates Competency\\\" on 2 of 4 exercises\n  D       Pass at least 7 of 15 quizzes, earn \\\"Demonstrates Competency\\\" on 1 of 4 exercises\n  F       Fail to clear D-level hurdles\n\nFor Step 2, your final course grade is determined as follows:\n\n-   If you earn at least 85% on the final exam, you will obtain a + for\n    your grade. So an A- base grade becomes a final A course grade, a B\n    becomes a B+, and so on (Note: SDSU does not record A+ grades).\n-   If you score between 70-85% on the final exam, your base grade\n    becomes your course grade.\n-   If you score between 50% and 69% on the final exam, you will obtain\n    a - for your grade. So an A becomes and A-, a B becomes a B-, and so\n    on.\n-   If you score less than 50% on the final exam, your course grade will\n    drop one level: An A- base grade becomes a final B- course grade.\n\n## Quizzes\n\nQuizzes are graded on a pass/fail basis. Starting in week two, there\nwill be a quiz due before each Monday session that pertains to the\nbackground reading that is required before our work in class.\n\n## Exercises\n\nFour exercises will be introduced in class and are to be completed outside of\nclass meetings.\n\nEach exercise is graded using a **CRN** rubric that classifies work with\nmarks of **C** (\\\"Demonstrates Competence\\\"), **R** (\\\"Needs\nRevision\\\"), or **N** (\\\"Not assessable\\\"):\n\nOf each exercise the following questions will be asked: Does the work\ndemonstrate that the student understands the concepts? Does the work\ndemonstrate competence and meet the expectations outlined in the\nexercise?\n\nIf the answer is \\\"yes\\\" to both of the questions, a student passes the\nhurdle for that exercise.\n\nIf the initial submission does not clear the hurdle, then a second\nquestion is asked: Is there evidence of partial understanding of the\nconcepts? If the answer to this question is \\\"Yes\\\" the student can\nexchange one token to attempt a revision of their work. If the answer is\n\\\"No\\\", the student does not clear the hurdle for this exercise and will\nnot have the opportunity to revise their work.\n\n\n## Final Exam\n\nA closed book, closed note, timed final exam will be given on **December 18\n(13:00-15:00)**. The exam will be based on a blend of previous quiz questions\nand additional questions that pertain to material covered in class.\n\n## Tokens\n\nEach student is provided with three tokens at the beginning of the\nsemester.\n\nUsing Tokens\n\n1.  One token can be used for a one-day extension for an exercise.\n\n2.  One token can be used to revise an exercise that was submitted\n    on-time but evaluated as \\\"Needing Revision\\\".\n\n3.  Two tokens can be used to request a make-up date for the final exam.\n   (Requests required by November 18 17:00.)\n\n\nRemaining Tokens\n\nEach token that remains unused after **12-18** will be counted as a passed\nquiz. *Tokens cannot be exchanged with other students*.\n\n## Policies\n### Accomodations\nIf you are a student with a disability and are in need of\naccommodations for this class, please contact Student Ability\nSuccess Center at (619) 594-6473 as soon as possible.  Please know\naccommodations are not retroactive, and I cannot provide\naccommodations based upon disability until I have received an\naccommodation letter from Student Ability Success Center.\n\n### Privacy and Intellectual Property\nStudent Privacy and Intellectual Property: The Family Educational\nRights and Privacy Act (FERPA) mandates the protection of student\ninformation, including contact information, grades, and graded\nassignments. I will use Canvas to communicate with you,\nand I will not post grades or leave graded assignments in public\nplaces. Students will be notified at the time of an assignment if\ncopies of student work will be retained beyond the end of the semester\nor used as examples for future students or the wider public. Students\nmaintain intellectual property rights to work products they create as\npart of this course unless they are formally notified otherwise.\n\n\n### Academic Integrity\n\nThe SDSU student academic integrity policy lists violations in detail.\nThese violations fall into eight broad areas that include but are not\nlimited to: cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, facilitating academic\nmisconduct, unauthorized collaboration, interference or sabotage,\nnon-compliance with research regulations and retaliation. For more\ninformation about the SDSU student academic integrity policy, please see\nthe following: <https://sacd.sdsu.edu/student-rights/academic-dishonesty>.\n\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nAs course instructor, I am dedicated to providing a harassment-free\nlearning experience for all students, regardless of gender, sexual\norientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,\nor choice of operating system. All course participants are expected to\nshow respect and courtesy to other students throughout the semester. As\na learning community we do not tolerate harassment of participants in\nany form.\n\n-   All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience\n    including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and\n    imagery are not appropriate in this course.\n\n-   Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other students. Behave\n    professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or\n    exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for this course.\n\n-   Students violating these rules may be asked to leave the course, and\n    their violations will be reported to the SDSU administration.\n\nThis code of conduct is an adaptation of the [SciPy 2018 Code of\nConduct](https://scipy2018.scipy.org/ehome/299527/648147/index9a04.html).\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
