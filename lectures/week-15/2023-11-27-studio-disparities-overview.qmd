## Research Questions in Spatial Disparities

::: {.incremental}
- Are the *burdens* of exposure to freeway air and noise pollution felt
  *disproportionately* by *different groups*?
- Ethnoracial disparities
- Socioeconomic disparities
- Intersectional disparities
:::

## Classic Research Design

::: {.incremental}
- Control and Treatment "Groups"
- Treatment Group: given the drug
- Control Group: given a placebo
- Test if outcomes are different between two groups
:::

## Spatial Research Design

::: {.incremental}
- Control and Treatment "Groups"
- Treatment Group: those exposed to freeway pollution
- Control Group: those not exposed to freeway pollution
- Test if outcomes are different between two groups
:::



## Spatial Research Design

- Control and Treatment "Groups"
- Treatment Group: those exposed to freeway pollution
- Control Group: those not exposed to freeway pollution
- Test if outcomes are different between two groups

**An individual's location determines their treatment status.**

## Spatial Research Design

::: {.incremental}
- Rephrase the research questions
- Are the populations exposed to different levels of freeway pollution different groups?
- Is the ethnoracial composition of the population of high pollution areas different from that of low pollution areas? 
- Is the socioeconomic status of the population of high pollution areas different from that of low pollution areas? 
:::


## Spatial Research Design (Qualifications)

::: {.incremental}
- Observational study versus randomized controlled trial
- Assignment is not random
- Individuals may interact (spatial interaction)
- Temporality
:::


# Implementation of Research Design

## Three Components of Research Design
::: {.incremental}
1. *Where* are the areas of high (low) exposure to freeway pollution?
2. *Who* lives in those areas?
3. Statistical Tests for difference in populations between these areas.
:::


## Geoprocessing in support of Spatial Disparities

1. *Where* are the areas of high (low) exposure to freeway pollution?

::: {.incremental}
- Unary Union
- Dissolve
- Clipping
- Buffering

## Statistical Evaluation of Hypotheses

### Ethnoracial Disparities

::: {.incremental}
- $H_0$ There is no difference in the ethnoracial composition of the population
in the high and low exposure areas.  
- $H_1$ There is a difference in the ethnoracial composition of the population
in the high and low exposure areas.
:::


### Socioeconomic Disparities
::: {.incremental}
- $H_0$ There is no difference in the socioeconomic status of the population
in the high and low exposure areas.  
- $H_1$ There is a difference in the socioeconomic status of the population
in the high and low exposure areas.
