Example on using the latexlides module, i.e., writing (LaTeX)
slides in Python.

Usage:

unix> python exampletalk.py
unix> # run last output line from the above command:
unix> latex exampletalk.tex; dvips exampletalk.dvi; ps2pdf exampletalk.ps; acroread exampletalk.pdf

Read the PDF file and this source code file in parallel. It takes 10 minutes,
and afterwards you are probably ready to write your own talk.
