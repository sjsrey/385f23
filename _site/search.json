    "text": "Introduction\nWelcome to 385: Spatial Data Analysis!\nThe purpose of this course is to introduce you to methods of spatial data analysis. The focus is on both the conceptual and applied aspects of spatial statistical methods. We will place particular emphasis on the computational aspects of Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) methods for three diï¬€erent types of spatial data: point processes, lattice, and geostatistical. We will also cover an introduction to regression analysis on spatially referenced data. Throughout the course you will gain valuable hands-on experience with several specialized software packages for spatial data analysis. The overriding goal of the course is for you to acquire familiarity with the fundamental methodological and operational issues in the statistical analysis of geographic information and the ability to extend these methods in your own research.\nThe course takes an explicitly computational thinking approach to its pedagogy. Students are introduced to computational concepts and tools that are increasingly important to research that engages with geospatial data. By adopting these tools, students acquire a deeper engagement with, and mastery of, the substantive concepts. Students will learn to code, and code to learn spatial data analysis.\nIn the scope of a 15-week semester course we can only introduce a handful of the key concepts and methods relevant to the field of spatial data analysis. As such, the course is not intended as an exhaustive treatment. Instead, the goal is that students will acquire an understanding of the more common and useful methods and practices, and use the course as an entry point for further engagement with the field."

    "text": "Grading\nGEOG385 uses specification grading in evaluating student work and in determining your final course grade. Your course grade will be based on the quality and quantity of the work that you submit that is evaluated to be of an acceptable level of quality. The acceptable level of quality demonstrates competency in the concepts and methods covered in the course.\nThere is a two-step process for determination of your final course grade at the end of the quarter:\n\nUsing your quizzes, exercises, and projects, your base grade is determined.\nUsing your final exam results, determine if your base grade includes a \"plus\", \"minus\", or level drop to form the course grade.\n\nFor Step 1, the base grade is determined using the following specification:\n\n\n\nLevel\nHurdles\n\n\n\n\nA-\nPass at least 13 of 15 quizzes, earn \"Demonstrates Competency\" on 4 of 4 exercises,\n\n\n\nand submit a project that earns \"Demonstrates Competency\"\n\n\nB\nPass at least 11 of 15 quizzes, earn \"Demonstrates Competency\" on 3 of 4 exercises\n\n\nC\nPass at least 9 of 15 quizzes, earn \"Demonstrates Competency\" on 2 of 4 exercises\n\n\nD\nPass at least 7 of 15 quizzes, earn \"Demonstrates Competency\" on 1 of 4 exercises\n\n\nF\nFail to clear D-level hurdles\n\n\n\nFor Step 2, your final course grade is determined as follows:\n\nIf you earn at least 85% on the final exam, you will obtain a + for your grade. So an A- base grade becomes a final A course grade, a B becomes a B+, and so on (Note: SDSU does not record A+ grades).\nIf you score between 70-85% on the final exam, your base grade becomes your course grade.\nIf you score between 50% and 69% on the final exam, you will obtain a - for your grade. So an A becomes and A-, a B becomes a B-, and so on.\nIf you score less than 50% on the final exam, your course grade will drop one level: An A- base grade becomes a final B- course grade."

Does the work demonstrate competence and meet the expectations outlined in the exercise?\nIf the answer is \"yes\" to both of the questions, a student passes the hurdle for that exercise.\nIf the initial submission does not clear the hurdle, then a second question is asked: Is there evidence of partial understanding of the concepts? If the answer to this question is \"Yes\" the student can exchange one token to attempt a revision of their work. If the answer is \"No\", the student does not clear the hurdle for this exercise and will not have the opportunity to revise their work."

Please know accommodations are not retroactive, and I cannot provide accommodations based upon disability until I have received an accommodation letter from Student Ability Success Center.\n\n\nPrivacy and Intellectual Property\nStudent Privacy and Intellectual Property: The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) mandates the protection of student information, including contact information, grades, and graded assignments. I will use Canvas to communicate with you, and I will not post grades or leave graded assignments in public places. Students will be notified at the time of an assignment if copies of student work will be retained beyond the end of the semester or used as examples for future students or the wider public. Students maintain intellectual property rights to work products they create as part of this course unless they are formally notified otherwise.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThe SDSU student academic integrity policy lists violations in detail. These violations fall into eight broad areas that include but are not limited to: cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, facilitating academic misconduct, unauthorized collaboration, interference or sabotage, non-compliance with research regulations and retaliation. For more information about the SDSU student academic integrity policy, please see the following: https://sacd.sdsu.edu/student-rights/academic-dishonesty.\n\n\nCode of Conduct\nAs course instructor, I am dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for all students, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or choice of operating system. All course participants are expected to show respect and courtesy to other students throughout the semester. As a learning community we do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.\n\nAll communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate in this course.\nBe kind to others. Do not insult or put down other students. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for this course.\nStudents violating these rules may be asked to leave the course, and their violations will be reported to the SDSU administration.\n\nThis code of conduct is an adaptation of the SciPy 2018 Code of Conduct."
